In this independent project, I conceptualized and developed a sophisticated React-based Single Page Application (SPA) specifically tailored to assist producers and DJs in curating captivating setlists for their live performances.

When the user navigates to the page, they are greeted with a sleek login page that displays the title of the application as well as interactable links to my social media accounts.

Upon selecting the login option, users are redirected through a secure and robust authentication process powered by Spotify OAuth. This authentication mechanism establishes a secure link between the web application and the user's Spotify account, thereby granting the application the necessary permissions to make authorized changes to their Spotify profile.

Post-login, the web application interacts with the Spotify API, retrieving and populating a comprehensive display of all the user's playlists. This page empowers users to effortlessly peruse and select their desired playlist, subsequently guiding them to the dynamic setlist creation page.

The set creation page provides users with an array of song information, including tempo (bpm), danceability, popularity, and musical key. Through an intuitive interface, users are empowered to handpick songs to add to their ideal setlist. With a simple click on the "create setlist" button, users are promptly guided to the page showcasing their crafted setlist.

I took personal pride in devising a unique formula used in the web application, which evaluates the ease of transitions between songs. This comprehensive algorithm factors in the attributes of each song, such as tempo and key, in order to assess the flow between selections, ultimately enriching the overall cohesion of the setlist.

To ensure flexibility and further refine the setlist, users are given the ability to edit and tailor their creation, fine-tuning it to perfection. Moreover, the web application facilitates the upload and synchronization of the final setlist directly to the user's Spotify account, ensuring that their curated selection is readily available for their performances.

In summary, this personal project exemplifies my dedication to crafting an exceptional user experience and showcases my love for music production. By integrating the realms of music curation, data analysis, and user-centric design, I successfully engineered an innovative web application that serves as an  tool for producers and DJs, empowering them to create captivating setlists for their live shows.
